Proposed Module List Entry:

Logfile        aupO  Generate reports from various logfiles

The Logfile extension will help you generating various reports from
different server logfiles. In general there is no restriction in what
information you extract from the logfiles. But the current simple
report generator always lists the fields 'Bytes' and 'Records' for
a given index. This should be enough for most server logfiles.  You
are free to misuse both as long as the fields contain numerical
values. 

Here are some examples of what it can do:
